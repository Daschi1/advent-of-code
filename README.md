# advent-of-code

Welcome to the Advent of Code[^aoc] Kotlin project created by [daschi1][github] using
the [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] delivered by JetBrains and modified by me to provide a more generic way
to declare puzzles.

In this repository, I provide my solutions for the puzzles using [Kotlin][kotlin].

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for
    twenty-five days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
